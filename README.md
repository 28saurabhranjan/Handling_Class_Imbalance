In this Class Imbalance Research project, I have reviewed two Review Papers on Handling Class Imbalance.

One of the review is "IMBALANCED DATASET CLASSIFICATION AND SOLUTIONS". Imbalanced data set problem occurs in classification, where the number of instances of one class is much lower than the instances of the other classes. The main challenge in imbalance problem is that the small classes are often more useful, but standard classifiers tend to be weighed down by the huge classes and ignore the tiny ones.
In order to highlight the implications of the imbalanced learning problem, this paper presents some of the fields such as, medical diagnosis, text classification, detection of oil spill in radar images, information retrieval that had problems on imbalanced dataset.

Other review paper is "Boosting methods for Multi‑class Imbalanced data classifcation". Multiclass Imbalanced data is much harder than binary datasets. This paper’s aim is to review the most significant published boosting techniques on multi-class imbalanced datasets. A thorough empirical comparison is conducted to analyze the performance of binary and multi-class boosting algorithms on various multi-class imbalanced datasets. The studies show that CatBoost and LogitBoost algorithms are superior to other boosting algorithms on multi class imbalanced and big datasets respectively. MMCC is a better evaluation metric than the MAUC and G-mean in multi-class imbalanced data domains.
